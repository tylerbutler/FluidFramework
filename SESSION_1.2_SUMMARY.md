# Session 1.2 Summary: Core-Interfaces Bazel Migration

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Duration**: ~2.5 hours
**Status**: Partial Success - Build working, tests blocked

## Accomplishments ✅

### 1. Working ESM and CJS Builds
Successfully configured and built @fluidframework/core-interfaces with:
- **ESM output**: `lib/` directory with .js, .d.ts, and source maps
- **CJS output**: `dist/` directory with .js, .d.ts, and source maps
- **Full TypeScript validation** enabled for both builds
- **25 TypeScript modules** compiled successfully

### 2. Resolved Critical Issues

#### TypeScript Version Configuration
- **Problem**: `ts_version_from` doesn't support semver ranges
- **Solution**: Fixed to exact version `5.4.5` in WORKSPACE.bazel
- **File**: `WORKSPACE.bazel:72`

#### Missing Toolchain Dependency
- **Problem**: rules_shell toolchain not found
- **Solution**: Added http_archive for rules_shell 0.4.0
- **File**: `WORKSPACE.bazel:50-56`

#### tsconfig extends Path Resolution
- **Problem**: Bazel sandbox can't resolve relative paths in tsconfig extends
- **Solution**: Created inline tsconfig files without extends
- **Files**:
  - `packages/common/core-interfaces/tsconfig.bazel.json`
  - `packages/common/core-interfaces/tsconfig.cjs.bazel.json`
  - `packages/common/core-interfaces/src/test/tsconfig.bazel.json`

#### npm Package Linking
- **Problem**: Mocha package not available as Bazel target
- **Solution**: Added `npm_link_all_packages` to root BUILD.bazel
- **File**: `BUILD.bazel`

#### ts_project Attribute Validation
- **Problem**: tsconfig options didn't match ts_project attributes
- **Solution**: Added matching attributes (composite, declaration_map, source_map, incremental)
- **File**: `packages/common/core-interfaces/BUILD.bazel`

### 3. Documentation Created
- **BAZEL_MIGRATION_ISSUES.md**: Comprehensive tracking of known issues, workarounds, and future work
- **SESSION_1.2_SUMMARY.md**: This document

## Blocked Items ⚠️

### Test Compilation
**Status**: BLOCKED - Deferred to Phase 2

**Problem**: Test files cannot resolve package-name imports in Bazel sandbox
- Tests import using `@fluidframework/core-interfaces/internal` (package names)
- Bazel's sandboxed ts_project doesn't have node_modules for resolution
- TypeScript path mappings cause out-of-memory errors (~2GB before crash)
- Without path mappings: 652 TypeScript errors across 15 test files

**Impact**: Cannot run Bazel-based tests yet

**Decision**: Focus on production build first, address test architecture systematically in Phase 2

## Technical Findings

### What Works
1. ✅ Inline tsconfig files (no extends) work in Bazel sandbox
2. ✅ ts_project with full validation and all compiler options
3. ✅ npm_translate_lock correctly processes pnpm-lock.yaml for dependencies
4. ✅ npm_link_all_packages makes npm deps available as `//:node_modules/package`
5. ✅ Dual ESM/CJS compilation with separate tsconfig files

### What Doesn't Work
1. ❌ tsconfig extends with relative paths in sandbox
2. ❌ TypeScript path mappings at scale (causes OOM)
3. ❌ @types packages not exposed by npm_translate_lock
4. ❌ Package-name imports in test files
5. ❌ `update_pnpm_lock = True` (pnpm/node version mismatch)

### Workarounds Implemented
1. **mocha.d.ts**: Minimal type declarations for mocha globals
   - Location: `packages/common/core-interfaces/src/test/mocha.d.ts`
   - Reason: @types/mocha not available in Bazel
   - Remove when: npm_translate_lock properly exposes @types packages

2. **Inline tsconfig files**: No extends, duplicated options
   - Reason: Sandbox path resolution issues
   - Remove when: Better tsconfig sharing mechanism found

## File Changes

### Modified Files
- `WORKSPACE.bazel`: TypeScript version, rules_shell dependency
- `BUILD.bazel`: npm_link_all_packages
- `common/build/build-common/BUILD.bazel`: Exports for tsconfig files
- `packages/common/core-interfaces/BUILD.bazel`: Complete ts_project setup

### New Files
- `packages/common/core-interfaces/tsconfig.bazel.json`: ESM config
- `packages/common/core-interfaces/tsconfig.cjs.bazel.json`: CJS config
- `packages/common/core-interfaces/src/test/tsconfig.bazel.json`: Test config
- `packages/common/core-interfaces/src/test/mocha.d.ts`: Mocha type declarations
- `BAZEL_MIGRATION_ISSUES.md`: Issues tracker
- `SESSION_1.2_SUMMARY.md`: This summary

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Session 1.3 or Later)
1. **Create output validation script** - Compare Bazel vs pnpm build outputs
2. **Update BAZEL_MIGRATION_TRACKER.md** - Mark Session 1.2 status
3. **Commit changes** with proper git message
4. **Test build in CI** - Ensure reproducibility

### Phase 2 - Test Architecture
1. **Research Bazel test patterns** for TypeScript packages
2. **Design module resolution strategy** for all packages
3. **Implement test compilation** systematically
4. **Consider test infrastructure** - jest vs mocha in Bazel

### Future Phases
1. **Bzlmod migration** - Move away from WORKSPACE (Bazel 9 requirement)
2. **@types package support** - Proper npm_translate_lock configuration
3. **pnpm/Node version alignment** - Enable auto-update features
4. **CI/CD integration** - Bazel remote cache, build automation

## Build Commands

### Build ESM
```bash
bazel build //packages/common/core-interfaces:core_interfaces_esm
```

### Build CJS
```bash
bazel build //packages/common/core-interfaces:core_interfaces_cjs
```

### Build Both
```bash
bazel build //packages/common/core-interfaces:core_interfaces
```

### Outputs
- ESM: `bazel-bin/packages/common/core-interfaces/lib/`
- CJS: `bazel-bin/packages/common/core-interfaces/dist/`

## Lessons Learned

1. **Work Through Issues**: User feedback was clear - don't skip validation or disable features. This led to proper solutions rather than shortcuts.

2. **TypeScript Path Mappings at Scale**: Path mappings can cause severe memory issues when TypeScript processes large directory trees. Be cautious with baseUrl and paths in large projects.

3. **Bazel Sandbox Isolation**: The sandbox is strict about path resolution. What works in normal TypeScript projects may not work in Bazel without adjustments.

4. **Inline Configuration**: For Bazel, self-contained configuration files (no extends, no external dependencies) are more reliable than shared configs.

5. **Test Complexity**: Test compilation is more complex than production code because tests often use package-name imports and have different module resolution needs.

6. **Document Everything**: Tracking issues, workarounds, and decisions is crucial for a long migration. The BAZEL_MIGRATION_ISSUES.md file will be invaluable for future sessions.

## Key Metrics

- **TypeScript errors fixed**: 1854 → 0 (for production code)
- **Build time**: ~0.3s (cached), ~5s (clean)
- **Files compiled**: 25 modules × 2 formats = 50 compilation units
- **Output files**: ~200 files (.js, .d.ts, .map files for ESM and CJS)
- **Time to first working build**: ~45 minutes
- **Time investigating tests**: ~90 minutes

## Success Criteria Met

- [x] ESM compilation working
- [x] CJS compilation working
- [x] Full TypeScript validation enabled
- [x] Source maps generated
- [x] Declaration maps generated
- [ ] Tests compiling (BLOCKED - deferred)
- [ ] Tests passing (BLOCKED - dependent on compilation)
- [ ] Output validation (TODO)

## Conclusion

Session 1.2 successfully migrated the core-interfaces package's production build to Bazel with full type checking and dual output formats. While test compilation is blocked by module resolution complexity, this is a known hard problem in Bazel TypeScript projects that warrants systematic design rather than quick fixes.

The working ESM and CJS builds demonstrate that the core Bazel setup is sound and can produce production-quality outputs. This foundation will support migrating additional packages in future sessions.
