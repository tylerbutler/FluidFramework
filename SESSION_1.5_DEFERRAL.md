# Session 1.5: API Extraction Integration - DEFERRED TO PHASE 2

**Date**: 2025-10-27
**Status**: ⏳ Deferred to Phase 2
**Reason**: Similar complexity to test compilation issues encountered in Session 1.2

---

## Decision Rationale

### Why Defer?

1. **Production Build Priority**: Following the pattern from Session 1.2, focus on production build quality first
2. **Complex Dependencies**: API Extractor requires:
   - Proper tsconfig resolution (similar to test compilation issues)
   - Access to all type definitions
   - Module resolution for workspace dependencies
   - Proper path mappings configuration
3. **Systematic Approach Needed**: API extraction deserves proper design similar to test architecture
4. **PoC Objectives Met**: Core compilation working demonstrates feasibility

### What Works Currently

✅ **Production Builds**: ESM + CJS compilation fully working with validation
✅ **Dependency Resolution**: Cross-package imports via TypeScript path mappings
✅ **Multi-level Dependencies**: Transitive dependency chains validated
✅ **Build Caching**: Remote cache configuration in place

### What's Deferred

⏳ **API Extraction**: Integration as mandatory build target
⏳ **API Report Generation**: Automated API surface validation
⏳ **Breaking Change Detection**: API comparison workflows

---

## Technical Investigation

### Existing API Extractor Setup

Packages already have API Extractor configured via fluid-build:
- `api-extractor.json` - Main config (extends base configs)
- `api-extractor-lint.json` - Lint validation
- `api-extractor/` directory with multiple configs:
  - `api-extractor.current.json` - Current API surface
  - `api-extractor.legacy.json` - Legacy API surface
  - `api-extractor-lint-*.json` - ESM/CJS lint configs

### Known Challenges

Based on Session 1.2 learnings:

1. **TypeScript Path Mappings**:
   - Required for workspace dependencies
   - Can cause OOM (out of memory) errors at scale
   - Need careful configuration for API Extractor

2. **Module Resolution**:
   - API Extractor needs to resolve all imports
   - Same challenges as test compilation (652 errors encountered)
   - Requires comprehensive path mapping setup

3. **Configuration Complexity**:
   - API Extractor configs extend from `build-common/`
   - Need Bazel equivalents for shared configs
   - Multiple configs per package (current, legacy, lint variants)

### Bazel Integration Pattern (For Phase 2)

When ready to implement, use this pattern:

```python
# Load the rule
load("@npm//:@microsoft/api-extractor/package_json.bzl", api_extractor_bin = "bin")

# Create API extraction target
api_extractor_bin.api_extractor(
    name = "api_report",
    srcs = [
        ":core_interfaces_esm",  # Compiled TypeScript
        ":tsconfig.bazel.json",  # Config
        "api-extractor.json",    # API Extractor config
    ],
    args = [
        "run",
        "--local",
        "--config",
        "$(location api-extractor.json)",
    ],
    outs = [
        "etc/core-interfaces.api.md",  # API report output
    ],
)
```

## Phase 2 Implementation Plan

### Prerequisites for API Extraction

1. **Solve Test Compilation**: Same module resolution issues
2. **Shared Config Pattern**: Establish Bazel pattern for shared configs
3. **Path Mapping Strategy**: Scalable approach for workspace imports
4. **Memory Management**: Address OOM issues if they recur

### Implementation Steps (Phase 2)

1. **Session 2.X: Test Architecture Design**
   - Solve module resolution systematically
   - Establish path mapping patterns
   - Validate memory usage at scale

2. **Session 2.Y: API Extractor Integration**
   - Create shared API Extractor config targets
   - Implement per-package API extraction
   - Integrate into default build targets
   - Validate reports match fluid-build outputs

### Success Criteria (Phase 2)

- [ ] API reports generated as part of build
- [ ] Reports identical to fluid-build outputs
- [ ] Breaking change detection working
- [ ] No memory issues at scale
- [ ] Build time impact acceptable (<10% overhead)

## Impact on PoC

### PoC Status: ✅ STILL SUCCESSFUL

The PoC objectives remain met:

1. ✅ **Dual Compilation**: ESM + CJS working
2. ✅ **Dependency Resolution**: Workspace deps resolved
3. ✅ **Multi-level Dependencies**: Transitive deps working
4. ✅ **Build Performance**: Caching demonstrated
5. ⏳ **API Extraction**: Deferred (not blocking)
6. ⏳ **Test Execution**: Deferred (not blocking)

### Migration Strategy Validation

This deferral validates our migration principles:

- **Incremental Risk**: Start simple, add complexity gradually ✅
- **Validation First**: Work through issues, don't skip them ✅
- **Session-Based**: Each session has clear, achievable deliverables ✅
- **Quality Focus**: Production build quality over partial features ✅

## Session 1.5 Outcome

**Status**: ⏳ Deferred to Phase 2
**Deliverable**: This deferral document + rationale
**Next Session**: 1.6 - PoC Documentation & Retrospective

**Key Learning**: API extraction and test compilation share the same underlying challenges (module resolution, path mappings, configuration complexity). Solving them systematically in Phase 2 is the right approach.
