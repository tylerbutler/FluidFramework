## Key Findings

### Project Scale
- **80+ packages** in main client workspace
- **65 client packages** (common, dds, drivers, framework, loader, runtime, utils, etc.)
- **500K+ lines** of TypeScript code
- **1.5MB** dependency lock file (pnpm-lock.yaml)

### Current Build System
- **fluid-build** - Custom task-based orchestrator
- **pnpm 10.18.3** - Workspace package manager
- **TypeScript 5.4.5** - Strict mode
- Dual compilation: ESM (lib/) + CJS (dist/)

### Recommended PoC Strategy

**Three-phase progression:**

1. **Phase 1 (2-3 hrs): @fluidframework/core-interfaces**
   - Zero dependencies (foundation layer)
   - Validates basic Bazel TypeScript setup
   - Risk: LOW

2. **Phase 2 (2-3 hrs): @fluidframework/driver-definitions**
   - Single workspace dependency
   - Tests inter-package dependency handling
   - Risk: LOW

3. **Phase 3 (3-4 hrs): @fluidframework/container-definitions**
   - Multi-dependency chain (both above packages)
   - Real-world complexity validation
   - Risk: MEDIUM

**Total PoC Time**: 12-16 hours (~2 days)

### Why These Packages?

- **Start with core-interfaces**: Zero production dependencies, pure type definitions
- **Add driver-definitions**: Tests workspace dependency resolution
- **Add container-definitions**: Validates complex dependency chains

This progression proves:
- Basic Bazel setup works
- Inter-package dependencies work
- Complex chains work
- Ready for broader migration

### Build Pattern Analysis

**Standard flow for all packages:**
```
src/ (TypeScript sources)
  → tsc (ESM: lib/)
  → fluid-tsc (CommonJS: dist/)
  → api-extractor (API reports)
  → mocha/jest (tests)
  → eslint/biome (linting)
```

**Key insight**: Consistent pattern across 80+ packages = great for Bazel rules

### Technology Stack
- **Languages**: TypeScript 5.4.5, ES2020+
- **Testing**: Mocha, Jest, c8, Puppeteer
- **Linting**: ESLint, Biome, good-fences, dependency-cruiser
- **API Tools**: Microsoft API-extractor
- **Build**: pnpm, TypeScript compiler

## Architecture Insights

### Layered Design
```
Core Interfaces (type definitions)
  ↓
Definition Packages (interfaces + minimal impl)
  ↓
Implementation Packages (full functionality)
  ↓
Utility Packages (cross-cutting)
```

### Type-First Approach
- Heavy use of TypeScript interfaces
- Type validation as first-class concern
- API reports for semantic versioning
- Breaking change detection via api-extractor

### Dependency Management
- All interdependencies use `workspace:~` pattern
- Tight version coupling required by framework
- External deps locked via pnpm-lock.yaml
- Patchable via .pnpmfile.cjs

## Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Dual output (ESM + CJS) | Bazel native multi-output support |
| API extraction complexity | Custom Bazel rules for api-extractor |
| Mixed test frameworks | Test framework abstraction layer |
| Large dependency tree | Proper Bazel dependency specification |
| Type validation chains | Type declaration management |

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: PoC (2 days)
- Establish Bazel patterns for foundation packages
- Validate ESM/CJS dual compilation
- Test workspace dependencies
- Confirm output equivalence

### Phase 2: Expansion (1 week)
- Migrate 10-15 packages across categories
- Expand test coverage
- Validate complex dependency chains

### Phase 3: Integration (2-4 weeks)
- Full monorepo migration
- Strangler pattern (parallel execution)
- Gradual replacement of fluid-build

## Success Criteria

- Identical build outputs to fluid-build
- All tests passing with same results
- Build time ≤ current system
- Deterministic, reproducible builds
- Incremental builds working
- No manual intervention needed

## Recommendations

### Best First Package
**@fluidframework/core-interfaces**
- Location: `packages/common/core-interfaces`
- Zero dependencies
- ~500-1000 LOC (pure interfaces)
- 2-3 hours to migrate
- Perfect for validating Bazel setup

### Key Success Factors
1. Focus on foundation packages first (zero deps)
2. Validate output equivalence with fluid-build
3. Use 3-package progression to manage complexity
4. Build Bazel rules that work for all packages
5. Establish patterns early, scale gradually

### Monorepo Strengths
- Clean package boundaries
- Consistent build patterns
- Clear architectural layers
- Comprehensive testing
- Well-documented

### Why Bazel is Suitable
- Deterministic builds
- Fast incremental builds
- Native parallel execution
- Excellent caching
- Strong TypeScript support
- Can coexist with pnpm/npm

## Next Steps

1. Review MONOREPO_ANALYSIS.md for full context
2. Study POC_PACKAGES.md for implementation details
3. Set up Bazel environment
4. Create BUILD file for core-interfaces
5. Run build and validate outputs
6. Move to phase 2 (driver-definitions)
